# Social Media

heroku: https://murmuring-gorge-71073-1b6f5a0e1f80.herokuapp.com/

## Description
This app is a very simple social media app. You can login, make an account and make posts. 

## Installation
Simply clone the github repo and run npm i in the root. Then, you login to mysql and run source db/schema.sql. Make sure the .env has your password. Then npm start starts it.
## Usage
Once youre on the homepage, you can create an account and start making posts.

## Testing
The testing was done incrementally. Working on every handlebars template one at a time helped my confusion. You can really get lost in this stuff

## Credits
The module 14 challenge folder helped me when I got really confused. I also made some changes to the CSS but the heroku app doesnt have them and im afraid of breaking it.
